Here’s a clean, professional README.md you can use for your GitHub repository that stores all your IntelliJ projects, Java codes, and learning concepts.

🧠 My Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my coding archive — a collection of everything I’ve practiced, learned, and built while exploring Java programming.
This repository contains code snippets, problem-solving exercises, and projects developed in IntelliJ IDEA, organized by topic for clarity and growth tracking.

📂 Contents
🏗️ Core Java

Variables, Data Types, Operators

Conditional Statements & Loops

Methods and Functions

Exception Handling

Input/Output and File Handling

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

Classes & Objects

Constructors & Method Overloading

Inheritance & Polymorphism

Abstraction & Interfaces

Encapsulation and Access Modifiers

🧩 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Arrays and Collections

Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

Searching and Sorting Algorithms

Recursion and Dynamic Programming Basics

🧮 Arrays

One-Dimensional and Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Common Array Problems (Sum, Reverse, Rotation, etc.)

Implementation of Array-based Algorithms

🔤 Strings

String Manipulation and Operations

StringBuilder & StringBuffer

Palindrome, Anagram, and Pattern Matching Problems

💻 Tools and Environment

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

Language: Java (JDK 17+)

Build Tool: Maven/Gradle (if applicable)

🎯 Purpose

This repository is my personal coding journal — a place to save all programs, track my learning progress, and strengthen problem-solving skills.
It’s also meant to help anyone beginning their journey in Java, OOPs, and DSA by providing clean, understandable examples.

🚀 Future Plans

Add more advanced topics (Collections Framework, Streams, Multithreading)

Include solved problems from coding platforms

Document each concept with explanations and visuals

🤝 Contributions

This repo mainly documents my learning path, but suggestions, optimizations, or new problem ideas are always welcome!
